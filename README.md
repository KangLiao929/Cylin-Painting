> ### Problem
> Given a fixed field of view (FoV) image, Cylin-Painting aims to extrapolate a 360째 texturally seamless and semantically consistent panormic image.
>  ### Features
>  * First effort to analyze the essential difference between image inpainting and image outpainting theoretically and experimentally
>  * Efficiently fuse the different spatial arrangements of the input image, which also enables a seamless 360째 panoramic image extrapolation
>  * Make an early attempt to systematically describe the strengths and limitations of positional encoding in CNNs. Furthermore, we tame the cylinder convolution with a novel learnable positional encoding, which essentially improves the generation results
>  * Our method can serve as a plug-and-play module and can flexibly extend to other 360째 panoramic vision tasks including the low-level tasks and high-level tasks
